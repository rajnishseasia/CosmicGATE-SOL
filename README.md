# CosmicGATE-SOL

CosmicGATE-SOL provides Solana blockchain integration for the CosmicGATE.ai ecosystem. It handles interactions with the Solana network, such as smart contracts, token operations, and DePIN-related functionality, written in Rust.

## Overview
This repository contains Rust-based programs and scripts for Solana blockchain operations, built with the `solana-sdk` and `anchor-lang` frameworks. It integrates with the CosmicGATE platform to enable decentralized applications on Solana.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Rust**: Version 1.60 or later. Install via `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`.
- **Solana CLI**: Install via `sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"`.
- **Anchor**: Install via `cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor anchor-cli --locked`.
- **Git**: For version control.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajnishseasia/CosmicGATE-SOL.git
   cd CosmicGATE-SOL
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
3. Configure Solana:
   - Set the Solana Devnet RPC endpoint:
     ```bash
     solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
     ```
   - Store credentials securely (e.g., in a Solana keypair file or environment variables).
4. Build and run programs:
   ```bash
   anchor build
   anchor test
   ```
